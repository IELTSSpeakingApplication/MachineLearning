# Machine Learning Part of IELTS Speaking Simulation Android Application

Welcome to the repository for the "IELTS Speaking Simulation" Android application, a remarkable project led by me (Hafid Ikhsan Arifin) as a Machine Learning Developers as part of a College Capstone Project. In this repository, you'll find all the resources, code, and documentation related to our application.

## Project Description
The "IELTS Speaking Simulation" Android application is a unique and innovative project designed to assist individuals in preparing for the IELTS Speaking test. This application leverages the power of machine learning to evaluate and provide feedback on various aspects of spoken English, including fluency, pronunciation, lexical skills, and grammar. Our team achieved remarkable results by developing and fine-tuning four distinct models for evaluating these IELTS Speaking test metrics.

## Key Highlights
- **Architecture Design:** We designed the application's architecture with a strong focus on performance and usability, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** We collected and preprocessed the necessary data to train and evaluate our machine learning models effectively. Data that we have been use:
1. Fluency: We collect from YouTube
2. Lexical: We collect from 4 dataset
3. Grammar: We use C4_200M grammar correction dataset
4. Lexical: We use Speechocean762 Dataset
- **Machine Learning Technologies:** Our project makes use of a wide range of machine learning tools and libraries, including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Transformers.
- **Model Performance:**
1. RNN-LSTM Model: Achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in assessing Fluency.
2. Wav2Vec2 Transformers Model: Attained 82% accuracy in assessing Pronunciation.
3. DistilBERT Transformers Model: Successfully evaluated Lexical skills with a 62% accuracy.
4. T5 Transformers GEC Model: Recorded the lowest loss at 0.562 when assessing Grammar.
- **Collaborative Development:** We worked closely with UI/UX design experts to create a user-friendly interface using Figma. Additionally, we collaborated with the Back-End team to seamlessly integrate the machine learning models into the application using Docker, Google Cloud Platform, and Flask.
